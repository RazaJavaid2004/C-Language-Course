/*
7. Consider the following program:
#include <stdio.h>
int main( void ) {
int *p1; 
char *p2;
p2=p1; 
}
Will the program compile successfully without warnings? Why and why not?
*/

The program will likely compile, but it will generate a warning. The warning is due to the assignment `p2 = p1;` which involves assigning a pointer of one type (`int *`) to a pointer of a different type (`char *`). This kind of pointer type mismatch typically triggers a warning in C.

### Reason for the Warning:
In C, pointers to different data types (such as `int` and `char`) are treated as pointers to different sizes and types of data. Assigning a pointer of one type to a pointer of another type without an explicit cast can lead to unintended behavior, as the compiler will flag it as potentially dangerous.

### Example Warning:
Depending on the compiler, you might see a warning message similar to:
```
warning: assignment from incompatible pointer type [-Wincompatible-pointer-types]
```

### Corrected Version:
To avoid the warning, you can explicitly cast the pointer to the correct type:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main( void ) {
    int *p1;
    char *p2;
    p2 = (char *)p1; // Explicitly cast the int pointer to a char pointer
    return 0;
}
```
This explicit cast informs the compiler that you are intentionally converting the pointer type, thereby suppressing the warning.

Feel free to try out the corrected version and observe the difference! If you have any more questions or need further assistance, just let me know! ðŸŒŸâœ¨
