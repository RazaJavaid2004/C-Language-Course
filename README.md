## 🧪 Highlighted Projects

Key projects developed during the course include:

- Scientific Calculator  
- Number Guessing Game  
- Bank Management System  
- Learning Management System  
- Hangman  
- To-Do List

## 🎯 Key Learning Outcomes

This course helped me build a strong foundation in:

- **Syntax & Data Types** — Variables, operators, and type declarations  
- **Control Structures** — `if`, `else`, `switch`, loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)  
- **Functions** — Definition, argument passing, and scope management  
- **Arrays & Strings** — 1D/2D arrays and string manipulation techniques  
- **Pointers & Memory** — Pointer arithmetic and dynamic memory (`malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, `free`)  
- **Structures & Unions** — Custom data types for modular design  
- **File I/O** — Reading from and writing to files for persistent storage
